# Stellar_structure_jhu

This repo stores the experiments results and corresponding files for numerical modeling for the internal structure of a hypothetical star, per coursework requirement for AS.171.611 - Stellar Structure and Evolution at Johns Hopkins University, spring 2025 semester. To check source codes for the modeling, please refer to Structure_Models.ipynb. To see machine-readable results from the modeling, please check Structure_custom_model.csv. Complementary reference of results calculated by MESA is stored in profile5.data, and OP_Table_Solar.csv contains the opacity values used in the calculations.
